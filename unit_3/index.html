		<h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
		<p>We believe that saying thank you is really important but that too much choice and expensive delivery costs make it harder than it needs to be. Gift giving is an emotional exchange and should be a delightful experience that makes both parties feel good inside. We harness technology to make this possible and to make it easy for you to be a good guest, friend or family member.</p>
		<h2>Special Offers</h2>
		<p>As we love gift giving we want to give our lovely customers some gifts of their own. £10 free for first time users and share your code for £10 off every time someone new signs up.</p>
